#### About my Full-Stack king-store-clothes app:

I created this app using React and Redux with redux-saga on the frontend. In my honest opinion using redux-saga is almost never a good choice, there's a lot of uneasy code to write & "getting used to" on your eyes - if I was to refactor my whole project I would go with RTKQ (Redux ToolKit Query) or even vanilla Redux would be a better choice over redux-saga.
On the backend I am using NodeJS with Express and using Cloud Firestore database by Firebase.
